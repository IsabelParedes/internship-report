\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to give a special thanks to Wolf Vollprecht and Carlos Herrero for providing me with their expertise and their continued support throughout this whole journey; without their guidance, none of this would have been possible. Along with that, I would like to thank Martin Renou for helping me bring the turtles to life. I must also thank Sylvain Corlay and the QuantStack team for welcoming me into this family. Finally, I would like to thank Markus Schmitz for initially nudging me into this path and for giving me the opportunity to continue growing.
